Currently the bot commands itself is hosted on Vercel because deta.space has cold start issues > 3 seconds.
- Downside of using Vercel is it inefficiently recreates event loop every request.
- Access to deta base takes longer.

Checking/cron jobs are handled by deta.space because latency doesn't matter over there.
